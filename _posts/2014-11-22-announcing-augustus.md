Surprise! He&#8217;s a boy! Of course we had too many girl names picked out and NO BOY NAMES! We left the birth center with &#8220;baby boy&#8221; and finally came to a conclusion at home. His middle name was easily chosen when we found out he was born on daddy&#8217;s great great grandfather Ebert&#8217;s birthday.

I&#8217;ll be on Maternity leave for the next couple of months and slowly transition back into work. Forgive me if response time is slower than usual.
