Folks, I want to share some exciting news! My very talented friend + artist, Katie French, has asked me to collaborate on some artwork with her. We&#8217;re combining our art + design skills to create some fresh designs that will very soon be displayed (at [Hair Lounge Minneapolis](http://hairloungeminneapolis.com/)) and for purchase. Please check out [Katie&#8217;s instagram](https://www.instagram.com/katiefrench_art/) feed to see her beautiful work! And please check out our instagram feed [(Kitty + Dot)](https://www.instagram.com/kittyanddot/) where we&#8217;ll be updating our progress.

A little tid-bit of info about our collaborative art name &#8220;Kitty + Dot&#8221;. Katie&#8217;s mom has called her &#8220;Kitty&#8221; her entire life and it&#8217;s something her friends have adapted. For me, growing up with an identical twin sister, people often asked &#8220;How can I tell you two apart?&#8221; and so we came up with the answer &#8220;Dena dot&#8221;. My dot is the distinguishing mole on my chin. And so years later was born Kitty + Dot.
